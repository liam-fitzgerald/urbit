::  group-store: Store groups of ships
::
::    group-store stores groups of ships, so that resources in other apps can be
::    associated with a group. The current model of group-store rolls
::    permissions and invites inside this store for simplicity reasons, although
::    these should be prised apart in a future revision of group store.
::
::
::    ## Scry paths
::
::    /y/groups:
::      A listing of the current groups
::    /x/groups/[resource]:
::      The group itself
::    /x/groups/[resource]/join/[ship]:
::      A flag indicated if the ship is permitted to join
::
::    ## Subscription paths
::
::    /groups:
::      A stream of the current updates to the state, sending the initial state
::      upon subscribe.
::
::    ##  Pokes
::
::    %group-action:
::      Modify the group. Further documented in /sur/group-store.hoon
